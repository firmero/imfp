<h2 class="subsection"> &nbsp; Description </h2> 
<br> 
Evaluates enclosure of range of polynomial using Horner form over <br> 
interval. <br> 
<br> 
<h2 class="subsection"> &nbsp; Input parameters </h2> 
<br> 
<b> p   </b> ... vector of polynomial coefficients [a_1 ... a_n] <br> 
<b> ix  </b> ... interval x <br> 
greater value leads to tighter enclosure <br> 
<br> 
p(x) = a_1*x^(n-1) + a_2*x^(n-2) + .. + a_(n-1)*x^1 + a_n <br> 
<br> 
<h2 class="subsection"> &nbsp; Output parameters </h2> 
<br> 
<b> ihf  </b> ... interval computed by Horner form <br> 
<b> ver  </b> ... if 1 then Horner form do not overestimate <br> 
<br> 
<h2 class="subsection"> &nbsp; Implementation details </h2> 
<br> 
The implementation tests sufficient condition for non-overestimation <br> 
of Horner form. The result of test is returned by variable ver. <br> 
<br> 
The condition is: if the intersection of io and interior of ix <br> 
is empty then Horner form is exact. <br> 
<br> 
io is the hull of all real x such that q_i(x) = 0 for some i in 1..n, <br> 
n = length(p). It's evident that 0 is in io, if degree is more than 0. <br> 
<br> 
q_i is defined for i = 1..n: <br> 
<br> 
q_1(x)     = a_1 <br> 
q_i(x)     = q_(i-1)(x)*x + a_i  for i = 2..n <br> 
<br> 
The range of Horner form of p is obviously q_n(ix). <br> 
<br> 
The emptiness of intersection of io and interior of ix is equivalent <br> 
to satisfying the following conditions: <br> 
<br> 
inf(ix) >= 0 and inf(HF(q_i,ix)) >= 0 for i=1..n <br> 
or <br> 
sup(ix) <= 0 and inf(sgn_i*HF(q_i,ix)) >= 0 for i=1..n <br> 
where sgn_j is defined for j = 1..n as: <br> 
sgn_j =  1 if j is odd <br> 
sgn_j = -1 if j is even <br>
